                            The Dark Side of the Moon is the band's eighth studio album.
                            british of
                            rock
                            progressive Pink Floyd, released on March 1, 1973. The album marks a new phase in the sound
                            of
                            band,
                            with
                            more personal lyrics and minor instrumentals, containing some of the most complicated uses
                            of the
                            instruments
                            and sound effects existing at the time, including the sound of someone running around a
                            microphone and
                            The
                            recording of multiple clocks playing at the same time.The themes explored in the work are
                            varied and personal, including greed, mental illness and
                            aging,
                            inspired mainly by the departure of Syd Barrett, a member who left the group in 1968
                            after
                            what
                            his mental health deteriorated. The basic concept of the album was developed when the band
                            I was
                            tour, and much of the new material was performed live, long before it was recorded. The band
                            produced the
                            work at London's Abbey Road Studios in different sessions in 1972 and 1973 alongside
                            producer
                            Alan
                            Parsons, directly responsible for the development of the most exotic sound elements
                            gifts

                            into a
                            rainbow,
                            was developed to symbolize the complexity that the band's sound hid behind its
                            appearance
                            simple.

                            Pink Floyd – The Wall is an animated/action psychological musical drama film
                            live
                            1982 British album directed by Alan Parker, based on the Pink Floyd album of the same name

                            physical and emotional wall to protect yourself.

                            Like its companion album, the film is highly metaphorical and frequently uses symbols.

                            Wish You Were Here is the ninth studio album by British progressive rock band Pink Floyd,
                            released in September 1975. Inspired by material composed by the group while touring Europe,
                            it was recorded after numerous sessions at Abbey Road Studios in London. . The album
                            explores themes such as absence, the music industry and the mental deterioration of Syd
                            Barrett, one of the band's founders. "Shine On You Crazy Diamond", in two parts, uniting
                            them with new compositions. "Shine On" is a tribute to Barrett,[5][7][8] who,
                            coincidentally, paid a visit to the studio while it was being recorded. The band was unable
                            to immediately recognize him, as he had gained weight and undergone changes in his
                            appearance.

                            As with their previous work, The Dark Side of the Moon, the band made use of studio effects
                            and synthesizers. The album's graphic design, again done by Storm Thorgerson, contained a
                            black sleeve hidden in the album art. Wish You Were Here debuted at a concert held in
                            Knebworth in July 1975 and was released in September of that year, becoming an instant hit.
                            As a result, the EMI label was unable to manufacture enough copies to satisfy the demand for
                            the disc. Although initially the album received mixed reviews, it was acclaimed by experts,
                            being listed at number 209 in Rolling Stone's "500 Best Albums Ever". David Gilmour and
                            Richard Wright have both stated that it is their favorite album by the band.

                            group's musical style. Animals was recorded at the band's studios, Britannia Row Studios, in
                            London and its production was marked by the first signs of discord that would later
